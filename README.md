# CreditCardFraudDetection


It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fradulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to identify fradulent credit card transactions.


Next Steps: Implement additional ML algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, SVM), advanced techniques for imbalanced data
